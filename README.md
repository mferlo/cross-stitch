A tool that takes bitmap files and generates a black and white image in a traditional cross-stitch pattern format.

Can also count the pixels; highlight individual colors; and set an color as the background (that is: don't include it in the pattern).

Caveats: This was developed as a personal project, and meets the needs of the user (i.e., me). I wouldn't use this on a particularly large image (say, over 300x300). The "Actual Size" is hard-coded to my monitor's resolution. When you generate the print image, after about 8 or so symbols it just gives up and starts using numbers. The UI is confusing. Requires Windows. The "Print" button just generates an image (in the same directory as where the image was loaded from) and doesn't actually print anything. And then whatever the various TODOs and FIXMEs are throughout the code.
